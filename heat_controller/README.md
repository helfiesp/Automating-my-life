<h1>Heat controller</h1>

This program was built to fix an old water based central heating system.<br>
The system would not properly turn on and off, and would consume massive amounts of power.<br>
To fix this issue, this program was made to turn the system on and off on a timer.<br>
The user can activate or change the run-time of the system via the webserver.<br><br>
